# IdentityUtils.Api.Models

This project contains all models which:
- Identity management API expects to recieve in one or more methods (typically as `[FromBody]` argument)
- Identity management API returns as result

It is formed as seperate project to avoid unnecessary dependencies to projects which use it.
